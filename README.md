# bloodgowhere

This is a project for our GDSC Solution Challenge.

What United Nations' Sustainable Development goal(s) AND target(s) did you choose for your solution: 
- Goal 3, Good Health and Well-Being: Ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all and for all ages
- Targets: Those who are physically able to donate blood, and people who are interested in donating blood

 Blood donation plays a critical role in saving lives and ensuring the health of a nation, but recently there has been an urgent need for blood donations due to dwindling blood stocks. Currently, blood donation systems do not have real-time, fast alerts which leads to a lot of rushing to request blood donations when stocks are dangerously low. To address these challenges and create a more active and responsive blood donation community in countries, a comprehensive mobile application combines donor awareness, emergency alerts and incentives
